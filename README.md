pyTwitchBot
===========

A simple twitch.tv IRC bot which respons to commands give in chat.

It's one of the first things I wrote in python, so it's pretty ugly. It's based off the code of a generic IRC bot, and was modified with some neat functions such as text logging, finding user quotes in logs, counting words, and responding to user input. 


In order to use it, you need to set a name, channel, and Oauth token. You can get a twitch oAuth token from www.twitchapps.com/tmi here
