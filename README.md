pyTwitchBot
===========

A simple twitch.tv IRC bot which respons to commands give in chat.

It's one of the first things I wrote in python, so it's pretty ugly. It's based off the code of a generic IRC bot, and was modified with some neat functions such as text logging, finding user quotes in logs, counting words, and responding to user input.
